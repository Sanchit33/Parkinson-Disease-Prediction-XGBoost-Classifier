Parkinson’s disease affects the CNS of the brain and it has no treatment yet detected early.​

Late detection leads to no treatment and loss of life.​

Early detection is very important.​

For early detection of the disease , ML algorithms like XGBoost algorithms are employed.​

XGBoost is the best algorithm to predict the onset of the disease which will enable early treatment and save a life.
